                  The greatest gift is a moment to experience life as it really
                  is, before its distorted by our humanity. That moment is a
                  universal right that every living being has, and we are all
                  able to reach it by ourselfs.

                  At the beginning, there is a brief period of silence
                  customized for each person. Plenty of caring and help for
                  those in trouble. Nothing is mandatory.

                  We have a mystic version of the Scandinavian sauna called a
                  temazcal. Natural meditations on the jungle, creeks, ocean and
                  bonefires that become effortless when mixed with silence.
                  Amazing hikes, playing in the ocean, walking on the beach. You
                  will be sweating, muddy, salty and wet - your inner child will
                  love it.

                  Most importantly you???ll be surrounded day and nighty by the

                  heard from countless cultures, our teachers and from mother
                  herself that nature is eager to welcome you back into her
                  arms.
